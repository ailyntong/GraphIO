# GraphIO

Input: Joystick values
Output: Encoder values

Takes I/O and graphs them

Need to work on: 
1. making compatible with robot - need Neelay to write program for communication between rio and graphs
2. being able to scroll back through history

Current Problems:
 - Controls (close window, pause, etc) only work when focus is on Win2
